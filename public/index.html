                            <p>Hi, I'm Cooper Runstein, a software developer from Portland, OR. Currently I live in Eugene,
                                OR while I attend University of Oregon. My software interests are in web development, both
                                frontend and backend. Right now React and Vue.js have captured my intrest.</p>
                            <p>I mostly work with Javascript and Python, though I'm interested in expanding into new lanaguages
                                when the opportunity arises. Currently my main venture is
                                <a href='http://spotcheckparking.com/'>SpotCheck Parking</a>, a machine vision startup.
                            I particularly enjoy testing and debugging code.</p>

                                <h3>CSS and HTML</h3>
                                <p>I began learning CSS and HTML in fall 2017. I began with the base languages, and moved into more advanced areas quickly.</p>
                                <p>I've used Bootstrap, Flexbox and Grid, though the new and modern Grid system is by far my favorite to work with.</p>
                                <p>Recently I've picked up SASS basics to help build my style sheets quickly.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h3>Javascript</h3>
                                <p>I began learning Javascript around the same time as HTML and CSS and it quickly overtook Python as my favorite langauge.</p>
                                <p>I've began using React and Vue as frotend technologies while experimenting with Node as a backend.</p>
                                <p>Tensorflow.js has made my affection for JS even stronger and I have a few web-based machine learning projects planned out.</p>
                            </div>
                            <div v-if="show === 3">
                                <h3>Python</h3>
                                <p>I began learning Python out of intrest in economic data science as a college Freshman, and instantly loved the langauge more than my own field of study.</p>
                                <p>Python turned programming from a hobby to a passion; the human-readable syntax and concise nature of the langauge has caused me to explore most new programming concepts through python.</p>
                                <p>Django was the first backend framework I learned, and the formed the base of my server-side knowledge</p>
                                <p>Tensorflow has made learning Machine Learning a breeze, and I love experimenting with audio and visual machine recognition.</p>

                                   <h3>Database Querying</h3>
                                   <p>I learned SQL alongside python while doing an economic research project, it was certainly not my favorite first time through.</p>
                                   <p>Since then I've grown to appreciate SQL and the power it offers.</p>
                                   <p>Recently I took a course on the NoSql technology MongoDB and found it easy and fun to use. </p>

                                <h3>Developer Tools</h3>
                                <p>Once I discoverd the ability to undo mistakes with Git, I began using it on every project almost daily.</p>
                                <p>Gulp, Webpack, Browserify, Babel and many more libraries and tools have helped me manage and grow my projects.</p>
                                <p>Pipenv and NPM for python and JS respectively have made sharing and managing projects much easier.</p>
                                <p>I've used numerous editors and IDEs, Atom, Webstorm and PyCharm to name a few. Today I mostly enjoy using Visual Studio Code.</p>
                                <p>I mostly use Linux as my operating system, and have worked through the linux from scratch manual with a friend.</p>
